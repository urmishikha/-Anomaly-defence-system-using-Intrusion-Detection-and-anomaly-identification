# -Anomaly-defence-system-using-Intrusion-Detection-and-anomaly-identification
 AI-powered cybersecurity systems are crucial for protecting sensitive data, offering students an exciting opportunity to explore anomaly detection and threat mitigation. Developing a cybersecurity AI with intrusion detection capabilities strengthens your understanding of machine learning, anomaly detection, and real-time alerting.
Key Project Features: Anomaly Detection: Build models that detect unusual activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or suspicious data transfers. Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Implement a system to identify and respond to potential security threats in real time. Threat Mitigation: Design automated responses to neutralize detected threats and prevent data breaches. To successfully develop an AI for cybersecurity, you will need the following tools.

Key Tools and Technologies
1. Programming Languages:
    * Python: Ideal for machine learning and data processing.
    * R: Useful for advanced statistical anomaly detection.
2. Machine Learning Libraries:
    * Scikit-learn: For training models such as SVM, Random Forest, and KMeans for anomaly detection.
    * TensorFlow/PyTorch: For building and training neural networks for deeper insights.
    * H2O.ai: Offers scalable machine learning models for anomaly detection.
3. Cybersecurity Tools:
    * Snort/Suricata: Open-source Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS).
    * Wireshark: For network traffic analysis and testing.
4. Data Processing Libraries:
    * Pandas: For handling and pre-processing large datasets.
    * NumPy: For numerical computation.
    * Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
5. Big Data Tools (Optional):
    * Apache Kafka: For real-time data streaming.
    * Elasticsearch: For indexing and querying logs efficiently.
6. Database Management:
    * MySQL/PostgreSQL: For storing and retrieving logs and metadata.
    * MongoDB: For unstructured data storage, like logs in JSON format.
7. Network Data Sources:
    * Kaggle Datasets: Public datasets for intrusion detection (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017).
    * Custom Logs: Simulate traffic using network security tools like Metasploit.
8. Alerting and Response:
    * Slack/Email APIs: For sending alerts.
    * Automation Tools: Python scripts or tools like Ansible for automated threat response.
Project Development Steps
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
    * Collect cybersecurity datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15).
    * Preprocess data (remove duplicates, handle missing values, normalize features).
    * Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Anomaly Detection:
    * Use unsupervised learning models like KMeans, DBSCAN, or Isolation Forest to detect unusual patterns.
    * Explore autoencoders or LSTMs for sequence-based anomaly detection.
3. Intrusion Detection System (IDS):
    * Implement classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) to categorize normal vs. malicious activities.
    * Train models on labeled datasets to identify specific attack types (e.g., DoS, SQL Injection, Brute Force).
4. Real-Time Monitoring:
    * Use Apache Kafka or Flask for real-time data ingestion.
    * Set up triggers to classify incoming logs and detect potential threats.
5. Threat Mitigation:
    * Create automated response scripts (e.g., shutting down suspicious IPs).
    * Design APIs or webhooks for integration with firewalls or access control systems.
6. Alerting Mechanisms:
    * Integrate with email, SMS, or chat applications to notify admins.
    * Visualize results using dashboards (e.g., Grafana, Tableau).
7. Testing and Deployment:
    * Test the system in controlled environments using simulated attacks.
    * Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) or local servers.

 # steps to make it run:
 
 1.run model.ipynb
 
 2.go to terminal
 
 3.type python app.py
 
 4.enter input in website interface
 
 5.pattern will be showed on screen,any irregular input will trigger the system and make it alert the user

 # work to be done:
 make a real time app out of it 

deploy on cloud platform
